### Plasmafox web browser

**Main differences between Plasmafox and Firefox:**
 - KDE integration
 - Compiled with GCC (before 69.0.2). Now (starting with 69.0.2) built with Clang.
 - Uses many system libraries (e.g. libvpx, nspr, icu, zlib etc.)
 - Some Mozilla services like Pocket, Telemetry, and Sync disabled to enhance privacy
 - Removed most of trademark-restricted marks like the name "Firefox" and the icons
 - (Currently) lacks some features like EME and WebRTC


**Credits go to Mozilla and:**
- [Waterfox project](https://github.com/MrAlex94/Waterfox/) for the inspiration
- [sgse](https://github.com/sgse) for the icons
- [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org) for the support
- [firefox-kde-opensuse](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/firefox-kde-opensuse/)
